        "In this study, I analyze a phenomenon on Wikipedia in which repeatedly clicking “first link” of a webpage invariably takes a user to the Philosophy page. I examine the percent of pages on Wikipedia in which this idea holds true in an effort to understand how Wikipedia’s network is structured and what that means for its user navigability and understanding. Previous research indicates that users’ page navigation is heavily focused on the lead of a Wikipedia article, rarely venturing beyond the first paragraph[@VisualClicks]; therefore, I limit my analysis to the first several links in this section; further analysis with greater computing power could be done on the links within the entire article. Amongst these first several links, I seek to determine if there are any other link locations that reach a specific page with any abnormal frequencies, including the philosophy page. To conduct my analysis, I construct a network using Wikipedia pages as nodes and the links on the page as directed links between nodes. I collected my data using a Breadth-First Search (BFS), meaning once I reach a page that has already been visited, I move on to another root page. With the network, I examine average path lengths to the philosophy page, the neighbors of the philosophy page that most commonly direct to it, and the structure of the first-link network itself. Furthermore, I examine the second link of Wikipedia pages and conduct and analysis of that network as well. My conclusions demonstrate the effectiveness of Wikipedia’s effort to make their introductory sentences and links sufficiently broad."

        "Wikipedia pages are built with the user’s understanding in mind. To ensure consistency across pages and maintain reliability as a credible source, there are extensive guidelines on the structure of each page. As one of the most important components of a Wikipedia page, linked content and the content of the lead paragraph is tightly monitored. Links serve to “provide instant pathways to locations within and outside the project that can increase readers' understanding of the topic at hand.”[@Wikipedia:ManualofStyle] Users will click on links when a topic is unfamiliar to them, or if they interested in learning more.\n",

It should be written in a clear, accessible style with a neutral point of view.[@Wikipedia:ManualofStyle]\n",

They explain that the “[The opening paragraph] should establish the context in which the topic is being considered by supplying the set of circumstances or facts that surround it. If appropriate, it should give the location and time.”[@Wikipedia:ManualofStyle] For example, a building’s first link will most likely be its location. Within that paragraph, its opening sentence is critical for my study as it will contain the first link. Editors are instructed that “the first sentence should tell the nonspecialist reader what or who the subject is, and often when or where.”[@Wikipedia:ManualofStyle] They go on to provide explicit instructions on what the first linked topic ought to be in an article: \n",

        "The first link of each page will be increasingly broad as you continue to click the first link. These instructions create a picture of how a topic like philosophy can be at the center of Wikipedia’s first link network. Conversely, it is doubtful that such a center exists for any other link placement. Even just the second link in an article can be increasingly specific, moving laterally or even backwards in specificity rather than towards larger hubs such as philosophy. Take one of Wikipedia’s examples in Harvey Lavan \"Van\" Cliburn Jr; his first link path begins with pianist then continues as follows: piano, keyboard instrument, musical instrument, music, art, creativity, psychology, mind, thought, consciousness, awareness, philosophy. With each passing link you can sense that your destiny on the philosophy page grows closer; the topics are broader and the connection from it to philosophy feels increasingly obvious. However, if we were to follow the second link, International Tchaikovsky Piano Competition, we find ourselves on the following path: Saint Petersburg, Russia, Eastern Europe, Ural Mountains, Eurasia, Europe, peninsulas, mainland, continent, regions, Earth’s surface, hemispheres, etc. Unlike with the first link, the second link gets stuck in geographic limbo without ever getting closer to a central topic like Philosophy. I will explore what a second link network looks like further in my analysis and see that geography, broadly speaking, is the typical destination of pages when clicking the second-link. \n",
        "\n",
        "There is special focus on the very beginning of a Wikipedia page because that is where users devote most of their attention. Dimitrov et al. utilize click data from Wikipedia’s navigation logs to construct a heat map of where users are clicking the most on Wikipedia pages. The heat map illustrates two clear dark red, high density, lines at the beginning of the page directly where the lead is located, demonstrating that users highest click rate is on links within the first few lines of the opening paragraph. The rest of the page is sparse beyond a preference for links on the left side of pages, a phenomenon the authors themselves do not fully understand.[@VisualClicks] However, the high click rate within the lead indicates to us that understanding the nature of the network of the first few links in an article is indicative of the nature of the network that users are typically interacting with.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research has already been done into the size of the Giant Connected Component (GCC) of nodes that connect to the philosophy node. In a study of Wikipedia’s navigability by language, as of 2017, 97.0% of pages in English will reach the philosophy page[@LamprechtNavigability], a slight increase of around 2.5% since 2011.[@Wikipedia:GettingtoPhilosophy] These numbers fluctuate across languages, with some languages have a center on pages such as \"Psychology\" in Spanish or \"Person\" in Japanese each with varying sizes but still having the majority of nodes reach these pages[@LamprechtNavigability]; my study will only be focused on the English network of Wikipedia. In the future, it would be interesting to study this phenomenon in other languages as I have done with English. In particular, previous studies indicate that Dutch has the smallest GCC with just 67.0% of nodes in its GCC.[@LamprechtNavigability] I would like to compare its network to English to understand this discrepancy. However, the English network is already far large enough for the scope of this study.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you would like to see how this network is formed beyond clicking through Wikipedia webpages on your own, the online page [xefer](https://www.xefer.com/wikipedia) will quickly build out a network of pages and their first links until you reach the philosophy page. This is a helpful tool that is good to visualize what this can look like in practice. However, it was designed to always reach the philosophy page even for those pages that manage to avoid the philosophy page. It does this by skipping to the second link on a page when it realizes it will not be able to reach the philosophy page through the first link.[@xefer] Therefore, we need to construct our own network to understand these disconnected nodes. \n",
        "\n",
        "To understand how a node can be disconnected, we ought to look at what makes philosophy the center of the network. If you click on the first link on the philosophy page, you go to the [existence page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence), which takes you to the [entity page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity), then right back to the existence page, forming a loop that makes out the \"bottom\" of this network. These pages are not nearly as central as philosophy, otherwise the phenomena would be about one of them instead. For another node to avoid the philosophy node, it would require a similar cycle or lack any link. Therefore, it is going to be a broad topic as it has to be something that could similarly be in the first sentence of a Wikipedia page. This eliminates hyper-specific pages from consideration despite them being the intuitive guess for what might manage to avoid philosophy. However, these specific pages can eventually lead to the broad pages that manage to cycle without hitting the philosophy page. Furthermore, there can also be pages with no links that function as dead-end pages. Wikipedia recently underwent an effort to remove all true dead-end pages (pages with zero links).[@Wikipedia:Dead-end_pages] Despite these efforts, there remain pages with no links as far as this study is concerned. For example, many sports pages have a lot of links, but they all lie within tables which are not included in this phenomena. For example, on [2011-12 Exeter City F.C. season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011-12_Exeter_City_F.C._season), there are tons of links but none in the *content* of the page. All of them are in tables or citations, meaning that this is a dead-end page for the philosophy phenomena. Additionally, this study does not consider links in lists, a choice explained in greater detail in the methods section.\n",
        "\n",
        "A page’s neighbors will remain within semantically related to that page amongst links in the lead. In a study that constructed Wikipedia’s network using the first ten links in an article as a node’s edges, it was determined that the nodes will form into communities of semantically related terms.[@MatasDomain] The mathematics page will be in a community of other topics related to math such as physics. For our sakes, this is an important result as it helps to paint a picture of what the branches stemming from philosophy’s neighbors will look like. For example, we can now expect all scientific terms to be connected in communities allowing them all to pass through the science page on their way to the philosophy page. \n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond some of the quicker results such as the size of the GCC, the average path length to philosophy, the number of disconnected components, and the nature of networks from other link locations, I will also look at the neighbors of the philosophy node. I also investigate the size of the GCC if the Philosophy node is removed and the size of other remaining large components. I hypothesize and found that the awareness node and its connecting parts form the basis of the GCC and that the component does not shrink by more than 10%. However, if awareness is removed as well, the GCC would shrink dramatically as the awareness node serves as a bridge between all scientific topics and all locations-based topics (buildings, monuments, historical figures)."

What is an incredibly easy task for the human eye proved to be quite difficult to program. If the task was to get the first link of any form on a page that would be quite easy. However, the more literal phenomena occurs with the first link to another Wikipedia page in the content section of the page that is not in parenthesis nor is a citation. To find this took a lot of trial and error as Wikipedia pages vary far more than you might think.\n",
        "\n",
        "I first tried to use the [Wikipedia API](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/). Its *links* attribute would have seemed to be an easy way to grab the links on a page. However, there is no functionality to get the links in order of appearance; instead, they are returned alphabetically. I briefly investigate ways to figure out which of these links came first by parsing the HTML but quickly found that it would just be easier to do the entire thing using the HTML.\n",

I then found all of the paragraph content on the Wikipedia page. I decided to excluded list components (bullet points) from my analysis as I felt they did not meet the same criteria as a link within a paragraph. This means that pages like [History of the Administrative Divisions of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_administrative_divisions_of_China) or [1965 Palanca Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965_Palanca_Awards) will have 'no links' as their are no links in their primary content. In future analysis, I hope to include these links and compare the results to see which is a better measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "From there, I found all of the hyperlinks in each paragraph, then got the href and class for each link. I used these to filter out any \"bad\" links such as citations, files, links that leave Wikipedia, and the most challenging, links within text parenthesis. This was a difficult decision as sometimes it would seem that the text here is meaningful. For example, [the Creativity page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity) has six parenthetical links before you reach the first link. However, most links inside parentheses are for translations and other self-referring content as seen on [the Ancient Greece page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece); referring to Greek here is wrong as that is in reference to the translation, not the content of the page itself. Therefore, parenthetical links were excluded using the *isValid(ref, paragraph)* function [from Christopher Chiche on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18916616/get-first-link-of-wikipedia-article-using-wikipedia-api). Finally, I only considered the first link in an actual paragraph on Calendar pages such as [Thout 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thout_1). These pages all have a first line of the calendar date, the calendar, and the next date on the calendar, meaning that when used it would take hundreds of pages to make it through the entire calendar. More importantly, this line is not a part of the actual content of the page which is what we want. These were detected and avoided by searching for the exact paragraph style they are found in. \n",
        "\n",
        "I then built a list of links and grabbed the first one. Typically, these href's were structured as /wiki/href. To get cleaner node names, I removed the /wiki/ as it would be repetitive to see it as a prefix on every single page. If there were no functional links on a page, it served as a dead-end for the network even though it may not be under [Wikipedia's definition of a Dead-End page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dead-end_pages). This effectively only applied for [Disambiguation Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disambiguation#Disambiguation_pages). If an *AttributeError* or *TypeError* occurs, which is rare, a unique string \"!FAIL!: \" is added to the front of the url to be detected later so as not to be confused with successful pages.\n",

For my final network, I set this to 50,000. However, this does not mean there are 50,000 pages in the network. Rather, there are the portion of usable pages plus all of the pages in between those seed pages and the philosophy page, resulting in 23,169 pages. With greater time and computing power, I would like to conduct a larger analysis, however, all of the values I discuss would not change in any statistically significant way as demonstrated in the convergence section of my analysis. \n",

See [List of painters by name beginning with \"P\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_painters_by_name_beginning_with_%22P%22) as an example. These are not pages that would impact Wikipedia's navigability and therefore we can exclude them as seed pages.

        "\n",
        "2. **Disambiguation Pages**: These pages were a much easier decision to skip as they contain no information. They serve to point users to actual pages when their search term was too vague. Additionally, they all lack a first link and would skew statistics such as the size of the GCC. See [Category: Disambiugation Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Disambiguation_pages) for more information and the [Art Disambiguation Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_(disambiguation)) as an example.\n",
        "\n",

If it is the first link of a different seed page, its url is added to the *fails* list which is manually checked at the end to repair any issues. These are, however, very rare (<1 in 1,000).\n",

        "Next, it normalizes the formatting for the first link by making it all lowercase. This is stored as a separate variable as capitalization is [case sensitive in Wikipedia Urls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Linking#:~:text=(Wikipedia%20article%20titles%20almost%20always,characters%20after%20the%20initial%20one.).

These are then organized into a row of a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) DataFrame called *convergence_df*. Out-Degree centrality was excluded because the out-degree of every page is 1, making all of their Out-Degree centralities identical. Additionally, eigenvector centrality was ignored as the idea that high degree nodes would be connected to one another is doubtful in this network. There is nothing to suggest that having a common first link makes that page itself also common. Given that the underlying assumption behind eigenvector centrality is not met by this network, it was not worth tracking. These are the values we will track to ensure the DataFrame is large enough that these values are no longer changing. This is by far the most time consuming part of the function. Once the network reaches a large enough size, these calculations can take several minutes, hence why they are only done 1% of the time to maximize efficiency. \n",

        "Finally, the first link is checked to determine if it is the philosophy page. In which case, we can now move on to a new seed page as we know its outcome. Then, it is checked to see if it returned to the seed page, meaning it looped back to itself; these are added to the list of disconnects. Most disconnects, however, are found in more central pages and have to be found later looking at Smaller Connected Components. They are then checked to see if they have already been visited, in which case we know their eventual outcome and can select a new seed page. Finally, if none of these conditions are met, it is added to the seen pages and searched for its own first link. This process continues until one of the previous criteria is met.\n",

Additionally, since it is more difficult to know the \"notable\" pages, these are selected by finding the top 3 pages in each centrality measure. Since we want to wait until a critical size to look into this, it does not start until the network has at least 3000 seed pages. There is also no reason to check each pages distance from the philosophy page in this network so that convergence measure has been eliminated. Similarly, it no longer stops looking for new pages at a specific page like it did for the philosophy page; now, it continues until it hits a page that we have already visited.\n",
        "\n",
        "I chose not to investigate any other link locations for a few reasons. First, as the link location grows, it becomes increasingly unlikely that a page has that many links on it, shrinking the network. Second, no patterns presented themselves within the second-link network that seemed necessary to investigate at other locations. And finally, as previously discussed, the opening line(s) of a Wikipedia article have significantly more guidance onto their structure and links [@Wikipedia:ManualofStyle]. Link locations beyond these are unlikely to be more than a random assortment of pages with no notable patterns, however, work would have to be done to prove this claim. \n",

        "First and foremost, it is clear that the Getting to Philosophy phenomena still holds true. With the vast majority of pages successfully leading to the philosophy page as you click on the first link of the page and every following page. While there was little doubt about this, it is good to see it confirmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within this, I found that it takes, on average, 11 pages to reach the philosophy page. However, you may find that it does not feel that way when you investigate it for yourself. Since we were looking at totally random Wikipedia pages, many of the pages were very specific. Unless you are quite imaginative, your tests may seem to be much closer to the philosophy page than the average node is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, my analysis suggests the network had shrunk from previous research's measurements. It will take further research to understand why this negative slope exists, however, it settles around 85.5% of the total network. This is a sharp drop from the previously found value of 97% [@LamprechtNavigability]. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, I would expect that they included links in lists in their analysis. More importantly, the 97% figure cited by Wikipedia [@Wikipedia:GettingtoPhilosophy] is not actually the number of pages that reach the Philosophy page from the first-link network. Rather, it is \"the percentage of articles which eventually lead to a cycle when repeatedly following first links.\" [@LamprechtNavigability] There are several of these cycles which occur without ever connecting to the Philosophy page. For example, the first link on [the money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) page is payment. Then, the first link on [the payment page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) is money. This loop blocks several nodes from ever reaching the philosophy page. Similar loops occur on the [name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name), [accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting), and [candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate) pages to name a few. This difference in methodology likely makes up for the near difference 10% difference here. Lamprecht et al. do list a figure for the amount of pages that link directly to the philosophy page of 92.1%. This much smaller difference is likely the result of including list links, the size of our networks, their use of the Wikipedia API, and changes in Wikipedia's network structure over the past seven years. Due to too many interacting variables, it is difficult to make a strong claim as to the true difference in the size of this component.\n",

        "### Why is the Philosophy Node Significant and What is the Nature of the Most Common First Links?\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the primary questions going into this study was why this phenomena occurs. After all, there seems no obvious answer on first thought. Philosophy professors would tell you it is because philosophy is \"the first science\" and is the study of nearly everything by that regard. Others might speculate that it is because it is, by nature, a meta discipline, contemplating the nature of other sciences. For any of these reasons and more, it appears as the first link on a few key pages. Namely, by being the first link on the [Awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness) and [the Philosophy of Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_logic) pages. By being the first link on just these two pages alone, philosophy is already connected to 83.58% percent of the network, meaning the remainder of philosophy's connections make up only around 2% of the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, in order to not lead to an even more central node, philosophy has to link back to itself. The first link network is so connected in the first-place due to Wikipedia's instructions to make the first link on a page increasingly broad[@Wikipedia:ManualofStyle]. This ensures that few pages are capable of these loops. We found that the most common first links often dealt with geography. This means that Wikipedia's instructions, as laid out in the introduction, were executed quite well. Pages are explained in their broadest terms first, particularly, by locating the topic in the world. This results in county, state, and other geographic terms taking the lead. Why *association_football* is so common remains a mystery, the prevalence of football (soccer) pages on Wikipedia would be an interesting subject to explore in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "Philosophy follows a path back to itself that is actually quite a bit longer than many of the cycles found in the network, many of which bounce right back to themselves from their first link. Philosophy, on the other hand, takes five additional pages (existence, entity, abstraction, rules, philosophy of logic) to get back to itself. Thus, technically, all of these pages are connected to such a vast portion of the network. These pages, are merely riding on philosophy's coattails in this technicality. Philosophy remains a dramatically more central node. Therefore, no matter why you think the neighbors of philosophy are so connected to so many pages, philosophy's connection to just a few important nodes and its self-loop are the root of this phenomena.\n",

        "Here, I had hypothesized to see that being closer to the philosophy page meant your topic was broader, resulting in a higher degree. For this to exist, we would near an r-value near negative one to indicate a strong negative correlation as I had hypothesize. This would have been quite an interesting discovery, but, unfortunately, I found no significance with an r-value of -0.08, no where close to what would be needed for significance. Whether such a significance could arise with a greater network size is unclear, but I remain curious as to whether this may be. I expect that the more specific topics near the philosophy page, such as specific philosophers or topics, drags this down. Additionally, my analysis was quite simple, with more time I would like to look into a more complex statistical analysis here to see if there is a correlation that extends beyond the eye.\n",

        "There is not as much to say here. First, no page presented itself as exhibiting anything similar to what was occurring with the philosophy page in the first-link network. I am further convinced that this is a phenomena unique to the first link location on Wikipedia pages. If the second link, which is the least random link besides the first, cannot form a connected component larger than even just 20% of the network, one must imagine that any other link location would form increasingly random and disconnected networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second-link network was able to create nice loops due to similar reasons as discussed with the first network, their links are prescribed to be broad. Again, you see geography take an even greater role in this network, likely because it still exists for buildings where the larger geographic context (such as first link city, second link state) is still present. Meanwhile, many objects that are described first go straight to their geographical location instead of the nature of what they are. Then, these locations would get back to themselves by looping on their broader locational significance, as a state in a federalist system, for example. \n",
        "\n",
        "While interesting in some regards, this network serves more as a reason to dismiss further studies of other link locations as they are increasingly unlikely to demonstrate a pattern of similar note to the first link network. "
